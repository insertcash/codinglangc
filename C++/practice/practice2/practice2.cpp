    // for those who need a refrence:
    /* Parentheses or Groups: first, do everything inside the parentheses. if there are more operations inside,
     * order of operations is recursive
     * Exponents: do exponents next (xË£, x^x)
     * Multiplication (and Division): do multiplication and division next. If multiple, do left to right
     * Subtraction (and Addition): same as multiplication and division, do left to right if multiple
     * If you need this explained, go back to sixth grade */
